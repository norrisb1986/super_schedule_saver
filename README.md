# super_schedule_saver
This is a Python project that creates a scheduler using classes and functions.

As anyone who has ever worked in food service will tell you, one of the most difficult tasks related to running a restaurant is scheduling staff. Some workers might only be able to work certain days, while others may prefer to take any open hours available. This project is designed to create a system where a manager can plug in details about each worker (such as days off, job title, preferred shifts) and out pops the weekly work schedule in seconds. What used to take an hour or more of a managerâ€™s time each week could in theory take only moments.

Structure:
This project uses classes and functions to create a system where a manager could input workers' names and positions at a restaurant to create schedules that can account for any scheduling conflicts and resolve them without the need for the manager to do this task manually.
